,Duck Butter,"""It is not a light movie (as the trailers might suggest), but it's a unique, refreshing one, driven by remarkable performances from Shawkat and Costa.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 8:07 AM UTC",Jade Budowski  Decider
,Hannah Gadsby: Nanette,"""This is different. Not a little different, but totally different.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 7:07 AM UTC",Linda Holmes  NPR
,Under the Tree (Undir trénu),"""Iceland's 90th Oscars entry, Under the Tree (Undir Trénu), manages to reach heights of absurdity but should also come with a serious disclaimer.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 7:07 AM UTC",Danielle Solzman  Solzy at the Movies
,Andre the Giant,"""Even if you're not a wrestling fan, you can appreciate a documentary about Andre the Giant...This is a standard but adoring portrait with a good deal of history.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 7:07 AM UTC",Christopher Campbell  Thrillist
,Game Night,"""Hollywood needs to be employing Rachel McAdams for more movies where she gets to show off such physical and verbal comedic timing and prowess. ""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 7:07 AM UTC",Christopher Campbell  Film School Rejects
,Paddington 2,"""The best movie of any and all genres this year.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 7:07 AM UTC",Christopher Campbell  Film School Rejects
3/4,Three Identical Strangers,"""Wardle makes ""Three Identical Strangers"" as spellbinding as a great psychological thriller.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 7:07 AM UTC",Moira MacDonald  Seattle Times
3.5/4,Sorry to Bother You,"""It works fine as an outrageous comedy, but the perceptive commentary will likely give it staying power. This is the fearless satire that America desperately needs right now.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 7:07 AM UTC",J.R. Kinnard  Seattle Times
7/10,Sicario: Day of the Soldado,"""Once you get past the murky political reasoning the events are taking place, it becomes a much better and enjoyable film.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 7:07 AM UTC",Katey Stoetzel  The Young Folks
3/5,Swimming with Men,"""It's very easy to get along with, boasting a big heart that it wears proudly.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 7:07 AM UTC",Ross Miller  The National (Scotland)
,Uncle Drew,"""A film based on one joke, but it's a good one.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 7:07 AM UTC",Leigh Monson  Birth.Movies.Death.
C-,Ant-Man and the Wasp,"""This terminally boring, by-the-numbers installment is credited to five screenwriters and all they've come up with is an inverse game of hot potato with the usual assembly of players (the good guys, the bad guys, the law and a wild card).""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 6:07 AM UTC",Laura Clifford  Reeling Reviews
,The Citizen (Az Allampolgar),"""Vranik's film couldn't be more timely in its moral inquiry, but it's timeless in form and technique, a melodrama tempered with a painstaking realism.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 6:07 AM UTC",Alan Scherstuhl  Village Voice
B,Ant-Man and the Wasp,"""It's fun, it's funny, and it's got such lower stakes than Avengers: Infinity War that it's practically the equivalent of a relaxing Sunday afternoon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 6:07 AM UTC",Britton Peele  Dallas Morning News
3.5/4,Leave No Trace,"""Foster and McKenzie are almost symbiotic here, with the young actress, a native of New Zealand, delivering a startlingly confident performance that is, by every measure, the equal of Foster's.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 6:07 AM UTC",Michael O'Sullivan  Washington Post
,Sorry to Bother You,"""If Mike Judge's ""Office Space"" and Robert Downey Sr.'s ""Putney Swope"" hooked up after a night of bingeing on hallucinogens, Marxist theory and the novels of Paul Beatty and Colson Whitehead, the offspring might look something like this.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 6:07 AM UTC",A.O. Scott  New York Times
2/5,Ideal Home,"""Often crass, generally bewildering.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 6:07 AM UTC",Hannah Woodhead  Little White Lies
,Feast of the Epiphany,"""Those interested in experimental works that incite contemplation and debate will find much to chew on throughout the course of this concise, canny effort...""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 6:07 AM UTC",Nick Schager  Variety
4/5,Whitney,"""A clear-sighted, compassionate portrait of a troubled soul.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 5:07 AM UTC",Allan Hunter  The List
3.5/5,Ant-Man and the Wasp,"""We'll get back to the fight against Thanos soon enough. Enthusiasts can resume arguing over various aspects of Marvel minutiae then. For now, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is a nice break.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 5:07 AM UTC",Bill Goodykoontz  Arizona Republic
2/4,Ant-Man and the Wasp,"""There's a lot going on here, which leads to a whole lot of gassy exposition to explain it all, including two separate scenes in which two different groups of good guys are tied to chairs while villains bloviate on the intricacies of the plot.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 5:07 AM UTC",Soren Anderson  Seattle Times
4/5,Three Identical Strangers,"""There's a large part of Three Identical Strangers that is disturbing, even though it's a smile-inducing miracle story about a family reunited, an early variant of the DNA pattern solving tv shows that abound today. ""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 5:07 AM UTC",Elias Savada  Film International
B,Ant-Man and the Wasp,"""Turns out there is a plot device more annoying than time travel - quantum. But the make-it-up-as-we-go-along story aside, Reed still has a flair for using toys at his disposal - glitchy shrinking/growing devices, sight gags, Scott's giant ant pals, etc.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 5:07 AM UTC",Jim Slotek  Original Cin
5/5,Shoplifters (Manbiki kazoku),"""Koreeda's quiet, angry masterpiece reaffirms once again that no other filmmaker working today has a better understanding of - or compassion for - families.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 3:07 AM UTC",James Marsh  South China Morning Post
5/5,First Reformed,"""The work of a passionate, intelligent and audacious artist who knows exactly what he wants to say and how he wants to say it.""  Posted Jul 3, 2018 3:07 AM UTC",Philip Concannon  The Skinny
